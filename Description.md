MUD is a text-based role-playing game project which I did in class which incoprorates both C and C++
the teacher provided guidlines, json files, and .o files to test and run the program with. The game 
lays the groundwork for today's visually rich games. In the games you can explore virtual realms, 
battle monsters, solve puzzles, socialize, and gather treasures—all through text commands. It’s like 
reading a fantasy novel where you shape the story.
